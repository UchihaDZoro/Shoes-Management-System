# Shoes-Management-System
A Python-based application for managing a shoe inventory using SQLite as the database and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). This system allows users to easily add, search, and manage shoe records in a structured and efficient way (i.e with use of shoe ID, name, brand, type, and price range).
